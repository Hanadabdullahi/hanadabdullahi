## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm Hanad Abdullahi, a final-year Uppsala University engineering student who has a deep interest in artificial intelligence and data science. I enjoy creating cutting-edge machine learning solutions and turning complicated datasets into understandable insights.

- ðŸ”­ I have recently finished my master's thesis at Karolinska Institute, where I developed a model that predicts age based on single-cell transcriptomic data. Due to possible patenting, it will be a private repo.
- ðŸ”­ No other projects as of now, send me a email if you have any ideas!




Among my areas of interest are:

â€¢ Data Science & Machine Learning: Statistical modeling, explainable AI, and deep learning applied to practical problems.
â€¢ Computational techniques include image analysis for predictive modeling, single-cell transcriptomics, and high-dimensional data processing.
â€¢ Software Development & Research: Developing effective Python solutions, streamlining experimental pipelines, and expanding the capabilities of contemporary artificial intelligence.
â€¢ Global Cooperation & Guidance: I thrive in diverse, team-oriented environments, which I draw from my leadership roles in student organizations and my exchange studies at the Technical University of Munich.


Thank you for visiting!
